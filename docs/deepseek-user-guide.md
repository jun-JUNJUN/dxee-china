## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Research Questions

**Good Questions:**
- "What are the main advantages of cloud computing for small businesses?"
- "How has artificial intelligence impacted healthcare delivery in 2024?"
- "What are the latest trends in sustainable packaging materials?"

**Less Effective Questions:**
- "Tell me about technology" (too broad)
- "Is AI good?" (requires opinion, not research)
- "What happened yesterday?" (too recent/specific)

### Question Types That Work Best

**Factual Research**
- Market analysis and trends
- Technology comparisons
- Industry statistics and data
- Scientific findings and studies

**Analytical Research**
- Benefits and drawbacks analysis
- Cause and effect relationships
- Comparative studies
- Best practices and recommendations

**Current Information**
- Recent developments (within cache period)
- Industry reports and updates
- Market conditions and changes
- Technology advancement

## Advanced Features

### Cache Performance

The system automatically caches research content for faster responses:

- **Cache Hit**: Research completes in 5-15 seconds using stored content
- **Cache Miss**: Fresh research takes 30-300 seconds with new content extraction
- **Cache Statistics**: Displayed in results showing hit/miss rates

### Relevance Filtering

Content is automatically filtered for quality:

- **High Relevance (9-10)**: Extremely relevant, high confidence
- **Good Relevance (7-8.9)**: Directly relevant, included in analysis  
- **Medium Relevance (5-6.9)**: Somewhat relevant, excluded from final analysis
- **Low Relevance (0-4.9)**: Not relevant, excluded from analysis

### Time Management

- **Standard Research**: Completes in 30-90 seconds
- **Complex Research**: May take 60-300 seconds
- **Automatic Timeout**: Research stops at 10 minutes with partial results
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time updates throughout the process

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**DeepSeek Button Not Visible**
- Refresh the page
- Check if you're logged in
- Try a different browser
- Contact support if problem persists

**Research Takes Too Long**
- Break complex questions into simpler parts
- Try more specific search terms
- Check your internet connection
- Wait for automatic timeout (10 minutes max)

**Poor Quality Results**
- Rephrase your question more specifically
- Include relevant keywords
- Try different angles of the same question
- Ensure question is factual rather than opinion-based

**"No High-Relevance Content Found"**
- Try broader search terms
- Rephrase the question
- Check if topic is too recent or niche
- Use alternative keywords

### Error Messages
