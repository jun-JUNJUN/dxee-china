# Web Research System Optimization - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical performance and reliability issues in the advanced web research system, specifically focusing on time management and token limit handling to ensure consistent, fast, and reliable research results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Time Management and Early Termination

**User Story:** As a user, I want research sessions to complete within 10 minutes maximum, so that I get timely results without excessive waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a research session starts THEN the system SHALL enforce a strict 10-minute (600 seconds) time limit
2. WHEN 8 minutes have elapsed THEN the system SHALL begin early termination procedures
3. WHEN the time limit is reached THEN the system SHALL immediately stop all content extraction and proceed to analysis with available data
4. WHEN early termination occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful response based on collected data
5. IF insufficient data is collected within time limits THEN the system SHALL return a partial result with clear indication of time constraints

### Requirement 2: Token Limit Management and Content Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle large amounts of content without API failures, so that I always receive a complete analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing content for analysis THEN the system SHALL count tokens before sending to DeepSeek API
2. WHEN content exceeds 50,000 tokens THEN the system SHALL intelligently summarize content to fit within limits
3. WHEN summarizing content THEN the system SHALL prioritize high-quality sources and preserve key information
4. WHEN token limits are approached THEN the system SHALL use progressive content reduction strategies
5. IF content still exceeds limits after summarization THEN the system SHALL process content in batches

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Content Prioritization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to focus on the most relevant and high-quality sources first, so that I get the best possible results even with time constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple sources are available THEN the system SHALL rank sources by quality score and relevance
2. WHEN time is limited THEN the system SHALL process highest-priority sources first
3. WHEN content extraction takes too long THEN the system SHALL skip low-priority sources
4. WHEN analysis begins THEN the system SHALL use the top 10 most relevant sources maximum
5. IF cache hits are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize cached content over new extractions

### Requirement 4: Progressive Response Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see research progress and get intermediate results, so that I understand what the system is finding even if it doesn't complete fully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research begins THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates every 30 seconds
2. WHEN significant findings are discovered THEN the system SHALL update the progressive answer
3. WHEN time limits approach THEN the system SHALL generate a summary with available data
4. WHEN research completes early THEN the system SHALL indicate what was accomplished vs. what was skipped
5. IF research is terminated early THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores based on data quality

### Requirement 5: Robust Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle API errors gracefully, so that I always get some form of useful response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DeepSeek API returns token limit errors THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce content size and retry
2. WHEN content extraction fails THEN the system SHALL continue with available sources
3. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide a basic summary from extracted content
4. WHEN multiple API errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff
5. IF all analysis methods fail THEN the system SHALL return structured data from successful extractions

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor research performance and identify bottlenecks, so that I can optimize the system over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research sessions run THEN the system SHALL track timing for each phase
2. WHEN content extraction occurs THEN the system SHALL monitor success rates and response times
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log token usage and response times
4. WHEN research completes THEN the system SHALL generate performance metrics
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log detailed diagnostic information

## Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics
- **Research Completion Time**: 95% of sessions complete within 10 minutes
- **Token Limit Compliance**: 100% of API calls stay within token limits
- **Content Processing Efficiency**: Average of 5-8 sources processed per minute
- **Cache Utilization**: >60% cache hit rate for repeated research topics

### Quality Metrics
- **Response Completeness**: 90% of responses contain meaningful analysis
- **Source Quality**: Average source quality score >6/10
- **User Satisfaction**: Research provides actionable insights even with time constraints
- **Error Recovery**: <5% of sessions fail completely due to technical issues

### Reliability Metrics
- **API Error Handling**: 100% of token limit errors handled gracefully
- **Time Limit Compliance**: 100% of sessions respect 10-minute maximum
- **Graceful Degradation**: System provides partial results when full analysis isn't possible
- **Progress Transparency**: Users receive clear status updates throughout the process
