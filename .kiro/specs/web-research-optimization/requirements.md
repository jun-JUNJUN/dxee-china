# Web Research System Optimization - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical bugs and reliability issues in the advanced web research system (v3.05), specifically focusing on iteration logic failures, statistical summary generation, relevance scoring inconsistencies, and content extraction issues with Bright Data API.

## Key Issues Identified

The following critical issues have been identified in the current web research system:

1. **Iteration Logic Not Working**: The system isn't performing follow-up iterations when relevance targets aren't met
2. **Statistical Summary Generation Failing**: The statistical summary shows "unknown" type and 0 sources  
3. **Relevance Scoring Inconsistency**: Shows 9/10 relevance in iteration but 0/10 in final results
4. **No Analysis Available**: The final comprehensive analysis is empty
5. **Content Extraction Issues**: Several extraction failures with Bright Data API

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Iteration Logic and Relevance Assessment

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to perform additional research iterations when initial results don't meet relevance targets, so that I get comprehensive results that fully address my question.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initial research shows relevance score < target relevance THEN the system SHALL trigger additional iteration rounds
2. WHEN performing iterations THEN the system SHALL generate refined search queries based on identified gaps
3. WHEN relevance targets are met THEN the system SHALL proceed to final analysis without additional iterations
4. WHEN maximum iterations (3) are reached THEN the system SHALL proceed with available data regardless of relevance score
5. IF relevance scoring is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL use the final analysis relevance score as authoritative

### Requirement 2: Fix Statistical Summary Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to generate accurate statistical summaries with proper data attribution, so that I can understand quantitative insights from the research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN statistical analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL extract numerical metrics from content successfully
2. WHEN generating statistical summaries THEN the system SHALL properly attribute data to source URLs
3. WHEN no statistical data is found THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate "no statistical data available" instead of showing unknown type
4. WHEN metrics are found THEN the system SHALL structure them with proper data types and source attribution
5. IF statistical extraction fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to qualitative analysis with clear indication

### Requirement 3: Fix Relevance Scoring Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent relevance scoring throughout the research process, so that I can trust the quality assessment of results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating relevance scores THEN the system SHALL use the same scoring methodology across all phases
2. WHEN displaying iteration relevance THEN the score SHALL match the final analysis relevance score
3. WHEN relevance scores differ THEN the system SHALL log the discrepancy for debugging
4. WHEN final analysis is generated THEN the relevance score SHALL reflect the actual content quality and question alignment
5. IF scoring methodology changes THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and clear documentation

### Requirement 4: Fix Empty Analysis Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the final comprehensive analysis to always contain meaningful content, so that I receive valuable insights from the research process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating final analysis THEN the system SHALL ensure non-empty comprehensive answer
2. WHEN analysis generation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with simplified prompts
3. WHEN content is available THEN the system SHALL generate analysis even if partial
4. WHEN JSON parsing fails THEN the system SHALL return structured fallback response
5. IF all analysis attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide summary of extracted content with clear error indication

### Requirement 5: Fix Bright Data API Content Extraction Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable content extraction from web sources, so that the research is based on complete and accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bright Data API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN extraction timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully and continue with other sources
3. WHEN API returns errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN content extraction succeeds partially THEN the system SHALL use available content and note missing sources
5. IF Bright Data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to alternative extraction methods

### Requirement 6: Time Management and Early Termination

**User Story:** As a user, I want research sessions to complete within 10 minutes maximum, so that I get timely results without excessive waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a research session starts THEN the system SHALL enforce a strict 10-minute (600 seconds) time limit
2. WHEN 8 minutes have elapsed THEN the system SHALL begin early termination procedures
3. WHEN the time limit is reached THEN the system SHALL immediately stop all content extraction and proceed to analysis with available data
4. WHEN early termination occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful response based on collected data
5. IF insufficient data is collected within time limits THEN the system SHALL return a partial result with clear indication of time constraints

### Requirement 7: Token Limit Management and Content Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle large amounts of content without API failures, so that I always receive a complete analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing content for analysis THEN the system SHALL count tokens before sending to DeepSeek API
2. WHEN content exceeds 50,000 tokens THEN the system SHALL intelligently summarize content to fit within limits
3. WHEN summarizing content THEN the system SHALL prioritize high-quality sources and preserve key information
4. WHEN token limits are approached THEN the system SHALL use progressive content reduction strategies
5. IF content still exceeds limits after summarization THEN the system SHALL process content in batches

### Requirement 8: Intelligent Content Prioritization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to focus on the most relevant and high-quality sources first, so that I get the best possible results even with time constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple sources are available THEN the system SHALL rank sources by quality score and relevance
2. WHEN time is limited THEN the system SHALL process highest-priority sources first
3. WHEN content extraction takes too long THEN the system SHALL skip low-priority sources
4. WHEN analysis begins THEN the system SHALL use the top 10 most relevant sources maximum
5. IF cache hits are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize cached content over new extractions

### Requirement 9: Progressive Response Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see research progress and get intermediate results, so that I understand what the system is finding even if it doesn't complete fully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research begins THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates every 30 seconds
2. WHEN significant findings are discovered THEN the system SHALL update the progressive answer
3. WHEN time limits approach THEN the system SHALL generate a summary with available data
4. WHEN research completes early THEN the system SHALL indicate what was accomplished vs. what was skipped
5. IF research is terminated early THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores based on data quality

### Requirement 10: Robust Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle API errors gracefully, so that I always get some form of useful response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DeepSeek API returns token limit errors THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce content size and retry
