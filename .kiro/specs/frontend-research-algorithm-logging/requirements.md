# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the advanced web research algorithm from `test_deepseek_advanced_web_research4_01.py` within the existing frontend/backend system, ensuring complete algorithm compatibility and standardized JSON log output. The system must produce research result logs that exactly match the format and structure of `research_results_20250904_104734.json`, enabling consistent analysis and comparison of research outputs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Algorithm Implementation Compatibility
**Objective:** As a research system, I want to implement the exact same research algorithm as test_deepseek_advanced_web_research4_01.py, so that research quality and methodology remain consistent across all system components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a research request is initiated THEN the Research System SHALL execute the same multi-phase research workflow as implemented in test_deepseek_advanced_web_research4_01.py
2. WHEN generating search queries THEN the Research System SHALL use the DeepThinkingEngine with identical query generation patterns (factual, comparative, temporal, statistical, and expert queries)
3. WHEN performing web searches THEN the Research System SHALL utilize Serper API integration with the same search parameters and advanced operators
4. WHEN extracting content THEN the Research System SHALL apply the same content scraping methodology with markdown extraction and metadata processing
5. WHEN evaluating relevance THEN the Research System SHALL use DeepSeek LLM with identical prompts to score content on a 0-10 scale with 70% threshold filtering
6. WHEN synthesizing answers THEN the Research System SHALL implement the same progressive answer building approach with confidence tracking and source attribution

### Requirement 2: JSON Log Output Format Compliance
**Objective:** As a system administrator, I want research logs to match the exact JSON format of research_results_20250904_104734.json, so that log analysis tools and comparison processes work consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a research session completes THEN the Research System SHALL output a JSON log file containing all required fields: question, answer, confidence, sources, statistics, metadata, and duration
2. WHEN generating the answer field THEN the Research System SHALL format content as markdown text with proper structure, citations, and gap analysis sections
3. WHEN calculating confidence THEN the Research System SHALL output a float value representing the progressive confidence score (0.0 to 1.0 range)
4. WHEN collecting sources THEN the Research System SHALL include an array of source URLs ordered by relevance score
5. WHEN extracting statistics THEN the Research System SHALL populate numbers_found, percentages, dates, and metrics objects with extracted statistical data
6. WHEN recording metadata THEN the Research System SHALL include relevance_threshold, timeout_reached boolean, and serper_requests count
7. WHEN measuring duration THEN the Research System SHALL record total research time in seconds as a float value

### Requirement 3: Research Workflow Orchestration
**Objective:** As a research orchestrator, I want to implement the exact same research algorithm as test_deepseek_advanced_web_research4_01.py with proper resource management and error handling, so that research sessions complete reliably within performance constraints.


#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating research THEN the Research System SHALL start a research session with timeout monitoring (600 seconds maximum)
2. WHEN generating queries THEN the Research System SHALL create up to the exact same number search queries as test_deepseek_advanced_web_research4_01.py using deep-thinking analysis patterns
3. WHEN executing searches THEN the Research System SHALL process queries concurrently with rate limiting and error recovery as the same as test_deepseek_advanced_web_research4_01.py
4. WHEN processing results THEN the Research System SHALL filter content by relevance threshold (â‰¥70%) and deduplicate sources
5. WHEN synthesizing answers THEN the Research System SHALL combine high-relevance content with statistical analysis and source attribution as the same as test_deepseek_advanced_web_research4_01.py
6. WHILE research is active THE Research System SHALL update progress tracking and maintain session state
7. WHEN research completes or times out THEN the Research System SHALL generate the final JSON log output with complete metadata

### Requirement 4: Performance and Caching Integration
**Objective:** As a system operator, I want research performance optimized through intelligent caching and resource management, so that the system scales efficiently while maintaining research quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN available THEN the Research System SHALL utilize MongoDB caching for web content with 30-day expiry
2. WHEN cache hits occur THEN the Research System SHALL increment cache_hits counter in the output metadata
3. WHEN managing tokens THEN the Research System SHALL optimize content within token limits using the TokenManager class
4. WHEN processing large content THEN the Research System SHALL batch content processing to stay within API rate limits
5. WHEN estimating costs THEN the Research System SHALL calculate and track token usage for cost monitoring
6. WHILE multiple research sessions run THE Research System SHALL manage concurrent processing with resource limits

### Requirement 5: Statistical Data Extraction
**Objective:** As a data analyst, I want comprehensive statistical information extracted from research sources, so that numerical insights and trends can be analyzed from the research results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing content THEN the Research System SHALL extract numerical values using regex patterns for numbers, percentages, and dates
2. WHEN identifying statistics THEN the Research System SHALL populate the numbers_found array with up to 10 significant numerical values
3. WHEN finding percentages THEN the Research System SHALL collect percentage values in the percentages array with proper formatting
4. WHEN extracting dates THEN the Research System SHALL identify and sort year values (20XX format) in the dates array
5. WHEN analyzing metrics THEN the Research System SHALL provide a metrics object structure for additional statistical data

### Requirement 6: Log Analysis and Comparison
**Objective:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to analyze differences between current system logs and reference logs, so that algorithm implementation accuracy can be verified and improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research logs are generated THEN the Research System SHALL create timestamped log files following the pattern research_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
2. WHEN comparing log formats THEN the Log Analysis Tool SHALL identify structural differences between generated logs and reference format
3. WHEN analyzing content differences THEN the Log Analysis Tool SHALL report variations in answer quality, source selection, and statistical extraction
4. WHEN validating compliance THEN the Log Analysis Tool SHALL verify that all required JSON fields are present and correctly formatted
5. WHERE log discrepancies exist THE Log Analysis Tool SHALL generate detailed comparison reports with specific field-by-field analysis
