# Requirements Specification

## Overview
Integrate the advanced web research algorithm from `test_deepseek_advanced_web_research3_07.py` as a "DeepSeek" button functionality in the existing chat interface. This will provide users with sophisticated research capabilities including multi-query generation, content extraction, MongoDB caching, statistical analysis, and comprehensive result formatting alongside the current streaming chat experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: DeepSeek Button Integration
**User Story:** As a chat user, I want to access advanced research capabilities through a dedicated "DeepSeek" button, so that I can get comprehensive web research with statistical analysis and source attribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user views the chat interface THEN they should see a prominent "DeepSeek" button or toggle option
2. WHEN the user clicks the "DeepSeek" button THEN the system should switch to advanced research mode with visual indicators
3. WHEN in DeepSeek mode THEN user input should trigger the enhanced research workflow instead of regular chat
4. IF the user switches modes THEN the current conversation context should be preserved

### Requirement 2: Advanced Research Workflow Integration
**User Story:** As a user, I want the DeepSeek button to execute the full research algorithm with real-time progress updates, so that I can track the research process and receive comprehensive results.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN DeepSeek research is initiated THEN the system should execute the 10-step research process:
   - MongoDB cache initialization and statistics
   - Multi-angle search query generation
   - Comprehensive web search with deduplication
   - Content extraction via Bright Data API
   - Gap identification and relevance scoring
   - Statistical summary generation
   - Iterative refinement if needed
   - Performance tracking and metrics
2. WHEN research is in progress THEN users should see real-time progress indicators showing current step and status
3. WHEN research completes THEN users should receive formatted results with statistical summaries and source attribution
4. IF research exceeds 10-minute time limit THEN the system should gracefully terminate and return partial results

### Requirement 3: MongoDB Caching Integration
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the DeepSeek functionality to leverage existing MongoDB infrastructure for content caching, so that repeated research queries are optimized and storage is consolidated.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN DeepSeek research runs THEN it should use the existing MongoDB connection and database
2. WHEN content is extracted THEN it should be cached in MongoDB with metadata (URL, timestamp, keywords)
3. WHEN similar queries are made THEN the system should retrieve cached content when available and fresh (â‰¤7 days)
4. IF cached content exists THEN display cache hit/miss statistics to users
5. WHEN cache statistics are requested THEN show total entries and fresh entries count

### Requirement 4: Streaming Results Display
**User Story:** As a user, I want to see DeepSeek research results stream in real-time like regular chat responses, so that I maintain a consistent user experience while getting progressive updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN DeepSeek research is active THEN progress updates should stream via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
2. WHEN each research step completes THEN users should see immediate feedback with step status and metrics
3. WHEN final results are ready THEN they should be formatted and streamed as markdown with proper sections
4. IF streaming fails THEN the system should fallback to batch result delivery
5. WHEN research is complete THEN results should be saved to chat history like regular messages

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Result Formatting
**User Story:** As a user, I want DeepSeek research results to be clearly formatted with statistical summaries, source attribution, and performance metrics, so that I can easily understand and verify the research findings.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN research completes THEN results should include:
   - Executive summary with key findings
   - Statistical data with numerical metrics when available
   - Source URLs with attribution for all claims
   - Relevance scores and confidence ratings
   - Performance metrics (time taken, sources analyzed, cache performance)
2. WHEN statistical data is available THEN display numerical rankings, revenue figures, market share data
3. WHEN no numerical data exists THEN provide qualitative analysis with clear methodology explanation
4. IF research partially completes THEN clearly indicate completion status and available data quality

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Environment Integration
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want DeepSeek functionality to integrate with existing environment configuration, so that API keys and settings maintain consistency with the current system.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application starts THEN DeepSeek functionality should validate required environment variables:
   - DEEPSEEK_API_KEY (existing)
   - GOOGLE_API_KEY (new requirement)
   - GOOGLE_CSE_ID (new requirement)
   - BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY (new requirement)
   - MONGODB_URI (existing)
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN provide clear error messages and graceful degradation
3. WHEN configuration is incomplete THEN disable DeepSeek button with tooltip explanation
4. IF Bright Data API is unavailable THEN fallback to basic content extraction with user notification

### Requirement 7: User Interface Enhancement
**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual indicators when using DeepSeek mode, so that I understand the different functionality and can easily switch between regular chat and research modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN DeepSeek mode is active THEN the interface should show:
   - Different visual styling or theme indication
   - Mode indicator label or badge
   - Research progress bar or spinner during processing
   - Step-by-step progress updates with timestamps
2. WHEN switching between modes THEN provide smooth transitions with clear state changes
3. WHEN research is running THEN disable mode switching until completion
4. IF research fails THEN display error messages with suggested troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Resilience
**User Story:** As a user, I want the DeepSeek functionality to handle errors gracefully, so that system failures don't disrupt my overall chat experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN API calls fail THEN retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
2. WHEN content extraction fails THEN continue with other sources and report partial results
3. WHEN MongoDB connection issues occur THEN disable caching but continue research with memory-only processing
4. IF DeepSeek API is unavailable THEN fallback to regular chat mode with user notification
5. WHEN timeout occurs THEN save partial progress and allow user to restart or continue

### Requirement 9: Performance and Resource Management
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want DeepSeek functionality to manage resources efficiently, so that it doesn't impact overall system performance for other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN DeepSeek research runs THEN it should respect the 10-minute time limit per session
2. WHEN multiple users use DeepSeek THEN implement request queuing to prevent resource exhaustion
3. WHEN content processing occurs THEN implement token counting and content summarization for large datasets
4. IF system resources are high THEN throttle concurrent DeepSeek requests
5. WHEN research completes THEN properly cleanup temporary resources and connections

### Requirement 10: Integration with Existing Chat Features
**User Story:** As a user, I want DeepSeek results to integrate seamlessly with existing chat features like history, sharing, and search, so that research results are treated as first-class content.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN DeepSeek research completes THEN results should be saved to chat history with proper metadata
2. WHEN viewing chat history THEN DeepSeek results should be clearly marked and searchable
3. WHEN sharing messages THEN DeepSeek research results should be shareable like regular chat messages
4. IF the user searches chat content THEN DeepSeek results should be indexed in Meilisearch
5. WHEN exporting chat history THEN include DeepSeek results with full formatting and source attribution
