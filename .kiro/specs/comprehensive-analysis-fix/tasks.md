## Implementation Notes

### Critical Code Locations
- **Score Calculation**: Lines 2376-2383 - final_metrics assignment logic
- **JSON Parsing**: Lines 1930-1980 - API response processing and score extraction  
- **Display Logic**: Lines 2800-2820 - comprehensive analysis formatting and display
- **Success Logic**: Lines 2825-2840 - success/failure determination

### Technology Constraints
- **Framework**: Python 3.11+ with asyncio patterns (existing Tornado integration)
- **Database**: MongoDB with Motor async driver (preserve existing caching)
